# sale-quick-buttons
Adds quick buttons to view pdf and html without downloading the sale orders.

**NB:** Honestly v12 already has a very good preview button that looks so nice
        it renders this module redundant and a lag. But just for the sake it is
        ported for anyone who would prefer it.
